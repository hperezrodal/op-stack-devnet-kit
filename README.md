# OP-STACK-DEVNET-KIT

`op-stack-devnet-kit` is a starter project for running a local Ethereum development stack with **L1 (Geth + Blockscout)** and **L2 (Optimism OP Stack + Blockscout)**.

It provides a ready-to-use Docker-based setup so developers can:

- Spin up their own Ethereum devnet in minutes.
- Deploy and test smart contracts across L1 and L2.
- Explore transactions with Blockscout block explorer.
- Build and experiment with rollups and dApps locally.

✨ Features

- ⚡ Local L1 with Geth
- 🔗 Blockscout explorer pre-configured for L1
- 🚀 L2 with OP Stack (Optimism rollup)
- 🧪 Ready for smart contract testing & deployments
- 🐳 Docker-based environment for easy setup and reproducibility

This kit is designed for developers who want to quickly prototype and build on Ethereum’s L1 + L2 stack without needing a complex cloud setup.
